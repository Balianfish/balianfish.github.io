				<center>	<h1>My PhD research</h1> </center>
   <p> My PhD research is on multiphase flows, which is a type of fluids flow involing two or more fluids. The interface separating the fluids is diffcult to deal with as it's a moving boundary with a crucial boundary condition. Our in-house research code tracks the interface explicitly using an adaptive moving mesh and solves the Navier-Stokes equations using finite element method. </p>
   <p> During my PhD, I have implemented non-isothermal effects (heat transfer, thermocapillarity and thermo-buoyancy) into the the existing code for isothermal multiphase flows; I have also developed a robust numerical treatment for interface topology changes such that our method can be applied to simulate flows with interface break-up; All modifications have been thouroughly validated through benchmark tests; The validated method is used to study the collision of two droplets and the break-up of a non-isothermal liquid bridge. The results have been summarised into two draft papers, one under review (</i><a href="http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~jl305/Papers/JCOMP-S-18-01810.pdf">manuscript</a>) and one under preparation. </p>
  <p> Below are some results demonstrating the capability of our research code: </p>

  <p> I am from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Linquan,+Fuyang,+Anhui,+China/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x35d222c997c4a813:0xf5718117a84c46eb?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjB4JKMmaziAhVIzBoKHSKFDQ4Q8gEwDnoECAwQBA">Linquan, Anhui, P.R. China</a>. In 2010, I was enrolled in the <a href="https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/"> Special Class of Gifted Young (SCGY) </a>, and then I spent the next four years in <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) </a>. I studied mechanics in USTC and got a bachelor degree in 2014. From 2014 to 2019, I did my Ph.D. in computational fluid dynamics at <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University Engineering Department (CUED)</a> supervised by <a href=http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~jl305/>Dr. Jie Li.</a> </p>
  <p> 我是程泽康，来自中国安徽临泉。我2010年至2014年在中国科学技术大学少年班
学习，专业为力学。2014年来到剑桥大学，在李杰博士的指导下进行计算两相流的研究，于
2019年获得博士学位。</p>
  <p> My PhD research is to develop an accurate and robust numerical method to simulate multiphase flows (<a href="/Research">see details</a>). I have also developed an interest in finance, and did a six-month internship as a quant analyst at Citi's Central Risk Trading desk (<a href="/Inten">see details</a>).
 <p>
 In my free time, I enjoy sports and like trying new ones. I used to play football at USTC and was a captain in the freshers' team in 2011. At Cambridge, I have tried rowing, white-water kayaking, squash... I was an active member in the <a href="https://www.cuhwc.org.uk/">Cambridge University Hillwalking Club</a>. I have also run two half marathon at Cambridge, and wish to run a full one someday.

  <p> I am from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Linquan,+Fuyang,+Anhui,+China/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x35d222c997c4a813:0xf5718117a84c46eb?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjB4JKMmaziAhVIzBoKHSKFDQ4Q8gEwDnoECAwQBA">Linquan, Anhui, P.R. China</a>. In 2010, I was enrolled in the <a href="https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/"> Special Class of Gifted Young (SCGY) </a>, and then I spent the next four years in <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) </a>. I studied mechanics in USTC and got a bachelor degree in 2014. From 2014 to 2019, I did my Ph.D. in computational fluid dynamics at <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University Engineering Department (CUED)</a> supervised by <a href=http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~jl305/>Dr. Jie Li.</a> </p>
  <p> 我是程泽康，来自中国安徽临泉。我2010年至2014年在中国科学技术大学少年班
学习，专业为力学。2014年来到剑桥大学，在李杰博士的指导下进行计算两相流的研究，于
2019年获得博士学位。</p>
  <p> My PhD research is on multiphase flows, which is a type of fluids flow involving two or more fluids. The goal was to develop an accurate and robust numerical method to simulate non-isothermal two-phase flows on an adaptive moving mesh. I have implemented physical models into the existing code and developed a numerical treatment for interface topology changes in the adaptive moving mesh system. These modifications have extended the applicable range of our numerical method. After being thoroughly tested, the method is then used to study binary droplet collision and non-isothermal liquid bridge break-up.  </p>
  <p> Having spent so many years in the university, I decided to explore how I can levearge my skillsets in the "real world". After I submitted my PhD thesis, I did a six-month internship as a quant analyst in Citi's Central Risk Desk (CRD). CRD manages a portfolio through which all the equity flows within the firm centralise, cross and liduidated back to the market. Using statistically-based alpha and risk models, CRD optimises the portfolio's holdings to maximizee the economic utility for the firm. My main responsibility during the internship was to use Python and kdb+/q for data analysis on CRD's PnL, the toxcity of the equity flows and the execution performance at different venues. I have also re-calibrated the trade volume profile used in the trade impact cost model of CRD's portfolio optimisation tool, and co-built a data analytic service which automatically gather data for CRD's daily work. Through the internship, I have gained exposure to portfolio optimisation and electronic trading, and would like to  </p>
